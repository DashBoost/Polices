By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.

## Accounts

When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.

You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.

You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.

When creating an account, you are able to pick a username. You shall not pick a username that, at our sole discretion, impersonates another user, impersonates an administrator, has graphic language, or is hateful. Doing so is a breach of these terms and may result in immediate termination of your account on our service.

## Termination

We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.

We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.

Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service.

All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.

## Proposals and Proposal Termination

A proposal is to be defined as any vote, poll, ballet, offer, or survey found at the web address dashboost.org/proposals or any other address on the service which could be construed to represent a vote, poll, ballet, offer, or survey. The submitter of a proposal may receive an amount of Dash from from us or third parties depending on various factors. We make no promises that any funds will be transferred under any circumstances, regardless of the result of the proposal. We cannot be held liable nor responsible for any lost funds, prospective or otherwise, or lost time due to any termination, or any damages based on direct, indirect, consequential, or other damages, or any cause of action based on fraud of a third party, detrimental reliance, or any other theory which may serve as a basis for  any cause of action related to any action or inaction we make.

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to terminate any proposal at any point in time for any reason, including but not limited to a proposal appearing to commit fraud, appearing to be malicious, appearing to have manipulated the site in such a way to give your proposal a greater chance to have a better result, or containing a scope which is contained within, equal to or less than another project funded by the Dash DAO or any other platform. 

You further acknowledge and agree that DashBoost shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection to the termination, editing, or cessation of a proposal.

In order to submit a proposal, a user must send a non-refundable fee of Dash to us. This payment in no way obligates DashBoost or any third party to any actions, further than allowing the user to submit a single proposal. Do not send this fee if you believe DashBoost or any third party is obligated or will become obligated to provide you or someone else any funds or services for any reason.
